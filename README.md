A1. Consider telephone book database of N clients. Make use of a hash table
implementation to quickly look up clientâ€˜s telephone number. Make use of two collision
handling techniques and compare them using number of comparisons required to find a
set of telephone numbers <br><br>

A2. Implement all the functions of a dictionary (ADT) using hashing and handle collisions
using chaining with / without replacement.
Data: Set of (key, value) pairs, Keys are mapped to values, Keys must be comparable,
Keys must be unique. Standard Operations: Insert(key, value), Find(key), Delete(key) <br><br>
B5. A book consists of chapters, chapters consist of sections and sections consist of
subsections. Construct a tree and print the nodes. Find the time and space requirements
of your method. <br><br>

B6.Beginning with an empty binary search tree, Construct binary search tree by inserting
the values in the order given. After constructing a binary tree -
i. Insert new node, ii. Find number of nodes in longest path from root, iii. Minimum data
value found in the tree, iv. Change a tree so that the roles of the left and right pointers
are swapped at every node, v. Search a value <br><br>

B11. A Dictionary stores keywords and its meanings. Provide facility for adding new
keywords, deleting keywords, updating values of any entry. Provide facility to display
whole data sorted in ascending/ Descending order. Also find how many maximum
comparisons may require for finding any keyword. Use Binary Search Tree for
implementation. <br><br>

C13. Represent a given graph using adjacency matrix/list to perform DFS and using adjacency
list to perform BFS. Use the map of the area around the college as the graph. Identify
the prominent land marks as nodes and perform DFS and BFS on that.<br><br>

C14. There are flight paths between cities. If there is a flight between city A and city B then
there is an edge between the cities. The cost of the edge can be the time that flight take
to reach city B from A, or the amount of fuel used for the journey. Represent this as a
graph. The node can be represented by airport name or name of the city. Use adjacency
list representation of the graph or use adjacency matrix representation of the graph.
Check whether the graph is connected or not. Justify the storage representation used.<br><br>

D18. Given sequence k = k1 <k2 < ... <kn of n sorted keys, with a search probability pi for each
key ki . Build the Binary search tree that has the least search cost given the access
probability for each key?
